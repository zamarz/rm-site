              <li>I have great interpersonal and communication skills after working as a journalist, communications consultant and copywriter for a number of years.</li>
              <li>I worked as a B2B tech writer but wanted to dive deeper into the industry so enlisted at a software development bootcamp which equipped me with essential skills including proficiency in JavaScript, React, Jest, Git and GitHub...and much more! </li>
              <li>Since graduating I have been learning refining my skills in personal projects and learning new things like TypeScript and Next.js.</li>

              <li>I've been part of a number of agile teams, in the UK and abroad, and know how to make full use of collaboration tech like Slack, Jira, and Trello.
