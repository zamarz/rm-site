This is a simple site that is acting as a cover letter for a job application.

It is a basic React Next.js site and can be easy to replicate. To get started, simply clone the repository, download the files, and make changes as needs be. Then follow the instructions below.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
